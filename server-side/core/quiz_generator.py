For each skill, generate an interactive quiz consisting of 3-5 multiple-choice questions with 4 options in each question, designed to assess the user's proficiency level.

        **<INSTRUCTIONS>**
        1. Skill Input: The list of 5 skills will be provided below.
        2. Quiz Generation: For each skill, create a multiple-choice quiz with 5-10 questions. Each question should:
        * Be clear and unambiguous.
        * Have four plausible answer choices (A, B, C, D), including one correct answer.
        * Focus on practical application and real-world scenarios relevant to the skill.
        * Be designed to assess both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Include questions that probe for depth of understanding beyond a superficial level.
        3. Gap Identification: Design questions that subtly probe for potential gaps in the user's understanding of each skill. These should be integrated naturally into the quiz, not stand out as obvious "trick" questions.
        **<INSTRUCTIONS/>**

        The output should be a list of JSON objects (each JSON object should correspond to a quiz question) with the following keys:
        'skill_area': The skill area on which the question is asked.
        'question': The question asked to the user.
        'options': Comma-separated list of options for the question.
        'answer': The correct option from all the options provided.
